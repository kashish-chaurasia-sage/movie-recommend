Movie Recommendation System - Python
==========================================================

Recommender system
------------------
A Recommender System or a Recommendation System is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item.
Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas including movies, music, news, books, research articles, search queries, social tags, and products in general.

The project is divided into three stages:
* Data Preprocessing
* Model Building
* Results Analysis
* Movie Recommendations
